# synthetic-staking-seward
This repository implements a staking reward system using Synthetic's algorithm with Scrypto programming language. 
ir is created within radixdlt-scrypto environment that you could find [here]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto)https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto).

# how is it works?
the algorithm it is similar with synthetic's :
$$r\left(u,a,b\right) = \sum_{t=a}^b R\frac{l\left(u,t\right)}{L\left(t\right)}$$
